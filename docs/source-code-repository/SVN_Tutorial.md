# SVN (Subversion) Tutorial

Subversion (SVN) is a version control system that allows you to manage changes to files and directories over time. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of using SVN.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with SVN, make sure you have the following installed:

- **SVN Client**: Download and install an SVN client for your operating system. For example:
  - For Windows: [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html)
  - For macOS: Install via Homebrew with `brew install svn`
  - For Linux: Install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install subversion`

### Verify Installation

To check if SVN is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
svn --version
```

---

## 2. Setting Up an SVN Repository

### Step 1: Create a Repository

To create a new SVN repository, use the following command:

```bash
svnadmin create /path/to/your/repository
```

Replace `/path/to/your/repository` with your desired repository path.

### Step 2: Accessing the Repository

To access the newly created repository, navigate to its URL or path. If you're using a local repository, the path will be where you created it.

---

## 3. Importing Files into the Repository

You can import files or directories into your SVN repository using the following command:

```bash
svn import /path/to/your/files file:///path/to/your/repository -m "Initial import"
```

Replace `/path/to/your/files` with the path to your local files and `/path/to/your/repository` with the repository path.

---

## 4. Checking Out a Working Copy

To work with files in your SVN repository, you need to check out a working copy:

```bash
svn checkout file:///path/to/your/repository /path/to/your/working-copy
```

Replace `/path/to/your/working-copy` with the directory where you want to create your working copy.

---

## 5. Basic SVN Commands

### Adding Files

To add a new file to your working copy and schedule it for addition to the repository:

```bash
svn add newfile.txt
```

### Committing Changes

To commit your changes to the repository:

```bash
svn commit -m "Commit message describing changes"
```

### Updating Your Working Copy

To update your working copy with changes from the repository:

```bash
svn update
```

### Viewing Status

To check the status of your working copy:

```bash
svn status
```

### Viewing Logs

To view the log of commits in the repository:

```bash
svn log
```

### Reverting Changes

To revert changes in your working copy:

```bash
svn revert filename
```

---

## 6. Branching and Tagging

### Creating a Branch

To create a branch in SVN, you typically create a copy of the trunk:

```bash
svn copy file:///path/to/your/repository/trunk file:///path/to/your/repository/branches/my-branch -m "Creating a new branch"
```

### Creating a Tag

Similarly, you can create a tag:

```bash
svn copy file:///path/to/your/repository/trunk file:///path/to/your/repository/tags/my-tag -m "Creating a new tag"
```

## 7. Conclusion

SVN is a powerful version control system that helps manage changes to files and directories. This tutorial covered the basics of setting up and using SVN, including repository management, basic commands, and branching/tagging.
