# Three.js Importing and Exporting Models Tutorial

Importing and exporting 3D models is a crucial feature of Three.js, allowing developers to use complex geometries and animations created in external applications. This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing models using various formats and exporting them from Three.js.

---

## 1. Introduction to Model Formats

Three.js supports several model formats, including:

- **GLTF/GLB**: A modern format that supports textures, animations, and more. Recommended for use with Three.js due to its efficiency and compatibility.
- **OBJ**: A simple format that supports geometry but does not handle animations or advanced material properties.
- **FBX**: A widely used format for animations and models, often requires additional loaders.

## 2. Importing Models

### Step 1: Include Necessary Loaders

To import models, you need to include the appropriate loaders in your project. For GLTF models, use `GLTFLoader`:

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Loading a GLTF Model

You can load a GLTF or GLB model using the `GLTFLoader`. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();

loader.load('path/to/model.glb', (gltf) => {
    const model = gltf.scene; // Access the loaded model
    scene.add(model); // Add the model to the scene

    // Optionally, set the model position or scale
    model.position.set(0, 0, 0);
    model.scale.set(1, 1, 1);
}, undefined, (error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred while loading the model:', error);
});
```

### Step 3: Using OBJLoader (Optional)

If you want to load OBJ models, include the `OBJLoader`:

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/loaders/OBJLoader.js"></script>
```

Then load the OBJ file:

```javascript
const objLoader = new THREE.OBJLoader();

objLoader.load('path/to/model.obj', (object) => {
    scene.add(object); // Add the loaded object to the scene
});
```

## 3. Exporting Models

### Step 1: Using the THREE.OBJExporter

To export your Three.js models to OBJ format, you can use `OBJExporter`:

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/exporters/OBJExporter.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Exporting the Scene

You can export the scene or a specific object as follows:

```javascript
function exportToOBJ() {
    const exporter = new THREE.OBJExporter();
    const result = exporter.parse(scene); // Export the scene to OBJ format

    // Download the exported model
    const blob = new Blob([result], { type: 'text/plain' });
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    link.download = 'model.obj'; // Set the filename
    link.click(); // Trigger the download
}
```

### Step 3: Using GLTFExporter

To export to the GLTF/GLB format, use `GLTFExporter`:

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/exporters/GLTFExporter.js"></script>
```

### Exporting the Scene

```javascript
function exportToGLTF() {
    const exporter = new THREE.GLTFExporter();
    exporter.parse(scene, (gltf) => {
        // Create a blob from the GLTF data
        const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(gltf)], { type: 'application/json' });
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        link.download = 'model.gltf'; // Set the filename
        link.click(); // Trigger the download
    });
}
```

In this tutorial, you learned how to import and export 3D models using Three.js. You can now easily integrate complex geometries and animations into your scenes and export your creations for use in other applications or sharing with others.
