# PostgreSQL Tutorial

## Introduction
PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses and extends the SQL language. It is known for its stability, flexibility, and advanced features.

## Installation

### Windows
1. Go to [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and download the installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the steps in the installation wizard.
3. During installation, make sure to install `pgAdmin` (a PostgreSQL management tool).

### Linux
Use the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### macOS
1. Install PostgreSQL via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install postgresql
```
2. Start PostgreSQL:
```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

## Basic Concepts

- **Database**: A container for storing data.
- **Table**: A collection of rows with the same columns.
- **Row**: A single data entry in a table.
- **Column**: A specific data field in a table.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a row.
- **Foreign Key**: A key used to link one table to another.

## Setting Up a Database

To create a new database:
```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
```

To connect to a database:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydb
```

## Data Types

PostgreSQL supports various data types:
- `INTEGER`: Whole numbers.
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length strings with a maximum length of `n`.
- `TEXT`: Unlimited-length strings.
- `BOOLEAN`: True or false values.
- `DATE`: Date values (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).

## Creating Tables

Example of creating a table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Inserting Data

To insert data into a table:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email) 
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
```

## Querying Data

To retrieve data from a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

To filter data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

To order results:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Updating Data

To update existing data:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET email = 'new_email@example.com' 
WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

## Deleting Data

To delete data from a table:
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides an introduction to PostgreSQL basics. PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database that offers advanced features like transactions, indexing, and more. You can expand on these concepts by exploring PostgreSQL documentation and advanced topics.
