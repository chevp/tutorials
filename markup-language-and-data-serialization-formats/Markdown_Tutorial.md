# Markdown Tutorial

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text. Itâ€™s widely used for documentation, README files, and web content because it is easy to read and write. This tutorial covers the basics of using Markdown syntax.

---

## 1. Basic Text Formatting

### Headings

Create headings using `#` symbols. More `#` symbols create smaller headings.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis

Use asterisks or underscores for emphasis:

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
***Bold and Italic***
```

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

Use `-`, `*`, or `+` to create unordered lists:

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item
```

#### Ordered Lists

Use numbers followed by a period to create ordered lists:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Sub-item
```

## 2. Links and Images

### Links

Create links by enclosing the text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses:

```markdown
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

### Images

Similar to links, but add an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning:

```markdown
![OpenAI Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
```

## 3. Code and Syntax Highlighting

### Inline Code

Use backticks (\`) for inline code:

```markdown
This is `inline code`.
```

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks:

    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello, World!");
    ```

---

## 4. Blockquotes

Use `>` for blockquotes:

```markdown
> This is a quote.
```

---

## 5. Tables

Create tables with pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`):

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
```

---

## 6. Horizontal Lines

Create horizontal lines with three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---
***
___
```

---

## 7. Checkboxes

Use `- [ ]` for checkboxes (useful in task lists):

```markdown
- [x] Completed Task
- [ ] Incomplete Task
```

---

## Summary

This tutorial covers the basics of Markdown:

1. Formatting text, lists, links, and images.
2. Writing code blocks and blockquotes.
3. Creating tables, horizontal lines, and checkboxes.

Markdown is versatile and simple, making it a powerful tool for documentation and web content.
