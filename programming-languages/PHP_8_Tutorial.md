# PHP 8 Tutorial

PHP 8 is a major update to the PHP language, introducing new features, optimizations, and improvements. It is widely used for server-side development in web applications.

---

## 1. Installing PHP 8

### Using Package Managers

#### For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y php8.0
```

#### For macOS (using Homebrew):

```bash
brew install php@8.0
```

#### For Windows:

Download the PHP 8 installer from the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads) and follow the installation instructions.

## 2. Basic PHP 8 Syntax

### Creating Your First PHP File

1. Create a file called `index.php`.
2. Add the following code:

    ```php
    <?php
    echo "Hello, PHP 8!";
    ?>
    ```

3. Run the file in your browser using a local server (e.g., XAMPP or `php -S localhost:8000`).

## 3. New Features in PHP 8

### 1. Named Arguments

You can specify only the arguments you want to set, skipping optional parameters.

```php
function greet($name, $greeting = "Hello") {
    echo "$greeting, $name!";
}

greet(name: "Alice", greeting: "Hi");
```

### 2. Union Types

Union types allow specifying multiple types for a parameter or return.

```php
function add(int|float $a, int|float $b): int|float {
    return $a + $b;
}
```

### 3. Match Expressions

The `match` expression is similar to `switch`, but more concise.

```php
$status = 'success';
$result = match($status) {
    'success' => "Operation successful!",
    'error' => "Operation failed!",
    default => "Unknown status",
};
echo $result;
```

### 4. Nullsafe Operator

The nullsafe operator (`?->`) prevents errors when calling methods on `null` objects.

```php
$person = null;
$name = $person?->getName();
```

## 4. PHP 8 Functions

### Defining a Function

```php
function sayHello($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}
sayHello("Alice");
```

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise syntax for one-line anonymous functions.

```php
$sum = fn($a, $b) => $a + $b;
echo $sum(5, 3);
```

---

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

PHP 8 supports OOP principles, such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Defining a Class

```php
class Person {
    public $name;

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function greet() {
        return "Hello, " . $this->name;
    }
}

$person = new Person("Alice");
echo $person->greet();
```

## 6. Error Handling and Exceptions

### Using Try-Catch Blocks

```php
try {
    throw new Exception("An error occurred");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Custom Exceptions

```php
class CustomException extends Exception {}

try {
    throw new CustomException("Custom error");
} catch (CustomException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

---

## 7. Working with Databases

### Connecting to MySQL with PDO

```php
$dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb";
$username = "root";
$password = "password";

try {
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
    echo "Connected successfully";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Performing CRUD Operations

#### Inserting Data

```php
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (:name, :email)";
$stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
$stmt->execute(['name' => 'Alice', 'email' => 'alice@example.com']);
```

#### Selecting Data

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
$stmt = $pdo->query($sql);
$users = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user['name'] . " - " . $user['email'] . "<br>";
}
```

---

## 8. Working with JSON

### Encoding and Decoding JSON

```php
$data = ["name" => "Alice", "age" => 30];
$json = json_encode($data);
echo $json; // {"name":"Alice","age":30}

$decoded = json_decode($json, true);
echo $decoded['name']; // Alice
```

---

## 9. PHP 8 Performance Optimization

### JIT Compilation

PHP 8 introduced the **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler** to improve performance.

Enable JIT in your `php.ini`:

```ini
opcache.enable=1
opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
opcache.jit=tracing
```

JIT helps speed up specific types of workloads, such as scientific computations.

## Summary

This tutorial covered the basics of PHP 8:

1. **Installing PHP 8** and creating a basic PHP file.
2. **Exploring new features** like named arguments, union types, match expressions, and the nullsafe operator.
3. **Using object-oriented programming** principles and error handling.
4. **Connecting to a MySQL database** with PDO.
5. **Working with JSON** data and understanding performance improvements with JIT.

PHP 8 brings many enhancements, making it a powerful language for modern web development.
