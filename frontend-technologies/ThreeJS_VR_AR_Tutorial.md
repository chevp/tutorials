# Three.js Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Tutorial

Three.js offers built-in support for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) experiences. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to create basic VR and AR applications using Three.js.

## 1. Introduction to VR and AR

### Virtual Reality (VR)

VR is a simulated environment that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. It immerses users in a 3D environment where they can interact with the surroundings.

### Augmented Reality (AR)

AR overlays digital content onto the real world. Users can see the real environment along with computer-generated graphics, providing a mixed experience.

## 2. Setting Up Your Project

### Step 1: Include Three.js and Required Libraries

You need to include the main Three.js library along with the VR and AR libraries. For AR, you may also want to include `AR.js` or `WebXR` API support.

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/VRButton.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Create a Basic Scene

Set up a basic Three.js scene:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
```

## 3. Creating a VR Experience

### Step 1: Enable VR Support

Three.js provides a VR button to enable VR experiences:

```javascript
document.body.appendChild(VRButton.createButton(renderer));
```

### Step 2: Adding 3D Objects

You can add 3D objects to your VR scene:

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
```

### Step 3: Animation Loop

Create an animation loop to render the VR scene:

```javascript
function animate() {
    renderer.setAnimationLoop(render); // Use setAnimationLoop for VR
}

function render() {
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate(); // Start the animation loop
```

## 4. Creating an AR Experience

### Step 1: Setting Up AR.js with A-Frame

To create an AR experience using A-Frame and AR.js:

```html
<a-scene embedded arjs='sourceType: webcam;'>
    <a-marker preset='hiro'>
        <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='color: yellow;'></a-box>
    </a-marker>
    <a-entity camera></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

### Step 2: Explanation of Code

- **a-scene**: The main container for the AR environment.
- **a-marker**: Defines the marker that will be tracked (e.g., the 'hiro' marker).
- **a-box**: A simple 3D object that will appear when the marker is detected.

### Step 3: Running Your AR Experience

Load your HTML file in a web browser that supports AR (like Chrome) and allow camera access. Point the camera at the marker, and you should see the AR object appear.
