# JSON Tutorial

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used in web development, APIs, and configuration files.

---

## 1. Basics of JSON

JSON represents data as key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces (`{}`):

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "location": "New York"
}
```

### Rules

1. **Keys** must be strings, enclosed in double quotes.
2. **Values** can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or `null`.
3. Data is separated by commas.

## 2. Data Types

### Strings

Strings are enclosed in double quotes:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Numbers

Numbers do not need quotes:

```json
{
    "age": 30
}
```

### Booleans and Null

Booleans are represented as `true` or `false`, and null values are represented as `null`:

```json
{
    "isActive": true,
    "middleName": null
}
```

---

## 3. Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists enclosed in square brackets (`[]`).

```json
{
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"]
}
```

Arrays can contain mixed data types, including other arrays and objects.

---

## 4. Nested Objects

Objects can be nested within other objects:

```json
{
    "person": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30
    },
    "location": "New York"
}
```

---

## 5. JSON in APIs

JSON is often used as the data format in APIs. For example, a response from an API might look like:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "Sample Item"
    }
}
```

---

## 6. JSON Schema

JSON Schema defines the structure and types expected in JSON data, used for validating JSON objects.

### Example Schema

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "age": { "type": "integer" },
        "isActive": { "type": "boolean" }
    },
    "required": ["name", "age"]
}
```

## Summary

This tutorial covered JSON basics:

1. Representing data with key-value pairs.
2. Using JSON data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.
3. Working with JSON in nested structures and APIs.
4. Introducing JSON schema for data validation.

JSONâ€™s simplicity and readability make it a widely-used format for data interchange and storage.
