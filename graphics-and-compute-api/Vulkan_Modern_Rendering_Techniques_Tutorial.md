# Vulkan Modern Rendering Techniques Tutorial

Vulkan provides a flexible and powerful API for implementing modern rendering techniques in graphics applications. This tutorial will guide you through several key modern rendering techniques that can be effectively implemented using Vulkan.

## 1. Introduction to Modern Rendering Techniques

Modern rendering techniques focus on achieving high visual fidelity and performance. Vulkan, with its low-level access to GPU resources and support for advanced rendering methods, is well-suited for implementing these techniques.

### Key Techniques Covered

- Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)
- Deferred Shading
- Shadow Mapping
- Post-Processing Effects

## 2. Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)

PBR is a rendering approach that aims to simulate the interaction between materials and light in a physically accurate way. It typically involves the use of two key components: the **Metallic-Roughness** workflow and the **BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)**.

### Step 1: Material Properties

Define material properties using textures such as albedo, metallic, and roughness maps.

### Step 2: Implementing the PBR Shader

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of a PBR fragment shader in GLSL:

```glsl
#version 450

layout(location = 0) in vec3 fragNormal;
layout(location = 1) in vec3 fragPosition;
layout(location = 2) in vec2 fragUV;

layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;

uniform sampler2D albedoMap;
uniform sampler2D metallicMap;
uniform sampler2D roughnessMap;
uniform vec3 lightPosition;
uniform vec3 cameraPosition;

void main() {
    vec3 albedo = texture(albedoMap, fragUV).rgb;
    float metallic = texture(metallicMap, fragUV).r;
    float roughness = texture(roughnessMap, fragUV).r;

    // Implement PBR calculations here (BRDF, lighting model, etc.)
}
```

## 3. Deferred Shading

Deferred shading is a technique that decouples scene geometry from lighting calculations, allowing for more complex scenes with many light sources.

### Step 1: Geometry Pass

In the geometry pass, render the scene geometry into multiple render targets (G-buffers) to store information such as position, normal, albedo, etc.

```c
// Bind G-buffers and render geometry
vkCmdBindFramebuffer(commandBuffer, gBufferFramebuffer, ...);
vkCmdDraw(...); // Render scene geometry
```

### Step 2: Lighting Pass

In the lighting pass, sample the G-buffers and apply lighting calculations based on the stored data.

```c
// Bind lighting framebuffer and perform lighting calculations
vkCmdBindFramebuffer(commandBuffer, lightingFramebuffer, ...);
// Perform lighting calculations using G-buffer data
```

## 4. Shadow Mapping

Shadow mapping is a technique used to create shadows in a scene by rendering depth information from the light's perspective.

### Step 1: Create Depth Texture

Create a depth texture to store depth information for the shadow map.

### Step 2: Render Scene from Light's Perspective

Render the scene from the light's perspective to populate the depth texture:

```c
// Set up light's view and projection matrices
// Render scene to depth texture
vkCmdBindFramebuffer(commandBuffer, depthFramebuffer, ...);
vkCmdDraw(...); // Render geometry for shadow map
```

### Step 3: Use Depth Texture in Main Pass

In the main pass, compare the current fragment's depth with the stored depth to determine if it is in shadow.

## 5. Post-Processing Effects

Post-processing effects enhance the visual quality of the rendered scene and can include effects like bloom, tone mapping, and anti-aliasing.

### Step 1: Implementing Bloom

To create a bloom effect, you can follow these steps:

1. Render the scene to a framebuffer.
2. Extract bright areas using a threshold.
3. Apply a Gaussian blur to the bright areas.
4. Combine the blurred image with the original scene.

### Step 2: Tone Mapping

Tone mapping is used to convert high dynamic range (HDR) colors to a displayable range. Implement tone mapping in a post-processing shader:

```glsl
#version 450
layout(binding = 0) uniform sampler2D hdrImage;

void main() {
    vec3 color = texture(hdrImage, fragUV).rgb;
    // Apply tone mapping algorithm here
    outColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

Vulkan's flexibility and low-level control make it an excellent choice for implementing modern rendering techniques. This tutorial covered several key techniques, including Physically-Based Rendering, Deferred Shading, Shadow Mapping, and Post-Processing Effects.
