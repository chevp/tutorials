# Vulkan Unified Graphics and Compute Tutorial

Vulkan provides a unified framework for handling both graphics and compute operations, allowing developers to utilize the same API for diverse tasks. This tutorial will guide you through the concepts and practices of using Vulkan for both graphics rendering and compute operations.

---

## 1. Introduction to Unified Graphics and Compute

Vulkan allows for seamless integration of graphics and compute workloads, enabling more flexible and efficient resource utilization. This unified approach can lead to better performance in applications requiring both rendering and compute tasks, such as gaming, simulations, and machine learning.

### Key Benefits of Unified Graphics and Compute

- **Resource Sharing**: Both graphics and compute tasks can share resources such as buffers and memory, reducing overhead.
- **Improved Performance**: Efficiently utilize the GPU for both rendering and compute workloads, maximizing throughput.
- **Simplified Development**: Use a single API to manage graphics and compute operations.

## 2. Setting Up Vulkan

### Step 1: Install Vulkan SDK

1. Download and install the Vulkan SDK from the [LunarG website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Set up a new project in your preferred IDE and include the Vulkan SDK headers and libraries in your project configuration.

## 3. Creating a Unified Pipeline

### Step 1: Define the Shader Stages

When using Vulkan, you'll define shaders for both graphics and compute operations. The pipeline can include different stages such as vertex, fragment, and compute.

#### Example Vertex Shader (GLSL)

```glsl
#version 450
layout(location = 0) in vec3 inPosition;
layout(location = 1) in vec3 inColor;

layout(location = 0) out vec3 fragColor;

void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(inPosition, 1.0);
    fragColor = inColor;
}
```

#### Example Fragment Shader (GLSL)

```glsl
#version 450
layout(location = 0) in vec3 fragColor;
layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
    outColor = vec4(fragColor, 1.0);
}
```

#### Example Compute Shader (GLSL)

```glsl
#version 450
layout(local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16) in;
layout(binding = 0) buffer Data {
    vec4 data[];
};

void main() {
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x + gl_GlobalInvocationID.y * 16; // Adjust based on local size
    data[index] = vec4(index, index, index, 1.0); // Example computation
}
```

### Step 2: Creating a Graphics Pipeline

Create a graphics pipeline that includes the shaders and necessary state configurations:

```c
VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo shaderStages[2];
shaderStages[0] = {VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO};
shaderStages[0].stage = VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT;
shaderStages[0].module = vertexShaderModule;
shaderStages[0].pName = "main";

shaderStages[1] = {VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO};
shaderStages[1].stage = VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT;
shaderStages[1].module = fragmentShaderModule;
shaderStages[1].pName = "main";

VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo pipelineInfo = {};
pipelineInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO;
pipelineInfo.stageCount = 2;
pipelineInfo.pStages = shaderStages;
// Configure other pipeline states (viewport, rasterizer, etc.)

if (vkCreateGraphicsPipelines(device, VK_NULL_HANDLE, 1, &pipelineInfo, nullptr, &graphicsPipeline) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to create graphics pipeline!");
}
```

### Step 3: Creating a Compute Pipeline

Similar to the graphics pipeline, create a compute pipeline:

```c
VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo computeShaderStage = {};
computeShaderStage.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO;
computeShaderStage.stage = VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT;
computeShaderStage.module = computeShaderModule;
computeShaderStage.pName = "main";

VkComputePipelineCreateInfo computePipelineInfo = {};
computePipelineInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMPUTE_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO;
computePipelineInfo.stage = computeShaderStage;
// Compute pipeline creation

if (vkCreateComputePipelines(device, VK_NULL_HANDLE, 1, &computePipelineInfo, nullptr, &computePipeline) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to create compute pipeline!");
}
```

---

## 4. Dispatching Compute Commands

To utilize the compute pipeline, you must dispatch commands to execute the compute shader:

```c
vkCmdBindPipeline(commandBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE, computePipeline);
vkCmdDispatch(commandBuffer, (width + 15) / 16, (height + 15) / 16, 1); // Dispatch compute workload
```

---

## 5. Synchronization Between Graphics and Compute

### Using Barriers

When using both graphics and compute pipelines, it's essential to synchronize resource access using barriers:

```c
VkMemoryBarrier memoryBarrier = {};
memoryBarrier.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_BARRIER;
memoryBarrier.srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_SHADER_WRITE_BIT;
memoryBarrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT;

vkCmdPipelineBarrier(commandBuffer,
                     VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COMPUTE_SHADER_BIT,
                     VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT,
                     0,
                     memoryBarrier.srcAccessMask,
                     memoryBarrier.dstAccessMask,
                     0, nullptr, 0, nullptr);
```

### Semaphores and Fences

Utilize semaphores and fences for synchronizing command submission and execution between graphics and compute operations.

Vulkan's unified support for graphics and compute operations allows developers to leverage the full capabilities of modern GPUs. This tutorial covered the basics of creating a unified pipeline, dispatching compute commands, and managing synchronization.
