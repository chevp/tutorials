## 3. Basic SQL Commands in MySQL

### Creating a Database

To create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db;
```

### Selecting a Database

To use a specific database:

```sql
USE example_db;
```

### Creating a Table

To create a table named `users` with some basic fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Inserting Data

To insert data into the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

### Querying Data

To retrieve all records from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### Updating Data

To update a user’s name in the `users` table:

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deleting Data

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## 4. User Management in MySQL

### Creating a New User

To create a new user with a password:

```sql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

### Granting Privileges

To grant all privileges on a specific database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON example_db.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Revoking Privileges

To revoke privileges from a user:

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON example_db.* FROM 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Deleting a User

To delete a user:

```sql
DROP USER 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

## 5. Backing Up and Restoring Databases

### Backing Up a Database

To back up a MySQL database using `mysqldump`:

```bash
mysqldump -u root -p example_db > example_db_backup.sql
```

### Restoring a Database

To restore a MySQL database from a backup file:

```bash
mysql -u root -p example_db < example_db_backup.sql
```

---

## 6. Useful MySQL Commands

### Show Databases

To list all databases:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Show Tables

To list all tables in the selected database:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

### Describe Table Structure

To show the structure of a table:

```sql
DESCRIBE users;
```

### Exiting the MySQL Client

To exit the MySQL client:

```sql
EXIT;
```
