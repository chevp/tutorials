# YAML Tutorial

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language often used for configuration files. It is structured and easy to read, making it a popular choice for defining configurations in software development.

## 1. Basics of YAML

### Key-Value Pairs

YAML represents data as key-value pairs, separated by colons:

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
location: New York
```

### Indentation

YAML uses indentation (usually two spaces) to define structure. Indentation represents nested data.

```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
```

---

## 2. Lists

Lists are created using hyphens (`-`).

### Example

```yaml
hobbies:
  - reading
  - hiking
  - coding
```

### Nested Lists

Lists can also contain complex data structures:

```yaml
people:
  - name: John Doe
    age: 30
  - name: Jane Doe
    age: 25
```

## 3. Comments

Use the `#` symbol to add comments:

```yaml
# This is a comment
name: John Doe  # Inline comment
```

---

## 4. Data Types

YAML supports strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.

```yaml
name: "John"      # String
age: 30           # Number
is_active: true   # Boolean
middle_name: null # Null
```

---

## 5. Multi-Line Strings

Multi-line strings can be created using `|` or `>`.

### Example

```yaml
description: |
  This is a multi-line
  string in YAML.
```

The `|` preserves line breaks, while `>` collapses line breaks into spaces.

---

## 6. Anchors and Aliases

Anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) allow you to reuse data.

### Example

```yaml
default_settings: &defaults
  theme: dark
  notifications: enabled

user_settings:
  <<: *defaults
  theme: light
```

In this example, `user_settings` inherits from `default_settings`.

## Summary

This tutorial covered YAML basics:

1. Defining key-value pairs and lists.
2. Using comments and data types.
3. Writing multi-line strings.
4. Reusing data with anchors and aliases.

YAMLâ€™s simplicity makes it a great choice for configuration files and data serialization.
