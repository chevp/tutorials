# Gradle Tutorial

Gradle is a powerful build automation tool used for Java, Android, and many other languages. It provides flexibility and control over build processes and dependency management, making it popular for large-scale projects.

---

## 1. Installing Gradle

### Step 1: Download Gradle

1. Go to the [Gradle website](https://gradle.org/releases/) and download the latest release.
2. Unzip the downloaded file and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Check if Gradle is installed by running:

```bash
gradle -v
```

---

## 2. Creating a Gradle Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your desired directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new Gradle project:

    ```bash
    gradle init
    ```

3. Choose the project type (e.g., application, library) and language (e.g., Java). Gradle will create a basic project structure with files like `build.gradle`.

---

## 3. Understanding `build.gradle`

The `build.gradle` file is the core of a Gradle project. It defines dependencies, plugins, and custom tasks.

### Example `build.gradle` for a Java Project

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}
```

### Key Sections

- **plugins**: Defines plugins to extend Gradle’s functionality.
- **repositories**: Specifies where to find dependencies (e.g., Maven Central).
- **dependencies**: Defines libraries and frameworks needed for the project.

---

## 4. Common Gradle Commands

- **Build**: Compile source code and generate output files.

    ```bash
    gradle build
    ```

- **Clean**: Delete build files and start fresh.

    ```bash
    gradle clean
    ```

- **Run Tests**: Execute tests defined in the project.

    ```bash
    gradle test
    ```

- **Execute Application**: Run the main application class (if it’s an application project).

    ```bash
    gradle run
    ```

- **Generate JAR**: Package the project into a JAR file.

    ```bash
    gradle jar
    ```

---

## 5. Managing Dependencies

Dependencies are managed in the `dependencies` block in `build.gradle`.

### Example

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework:spring-core:5.3.8'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}
```

- **implementation**: Adds a dependency for runtime and compile-time use.
- **testImplementation**: Adds a dependency only for testing.

---

## 6. Using Gradle Wrapper

The **Gradle Wrapper** allows you to run a specific Gradle version, ensuring consistency across environments.

### Adding the Wrapper

To add the Gradle Wrapper to your project, run:

```bash
gradle wrapper
```

This creates files like `gradlew` (a shell script) and `gradlew.bat` (for Windows).

### Running with the Wrapper

Instead of using `gradle` commands, use `./gradlew`:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

---

## 7. Custom Tasks

Gradle allows you to define custom tasks in `build.gradle`.

### Example

```groovy
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello, Gradle!'
    }
}
```

Run the custom task with:

```bash
gradle hello
```

---

## 8. Multi-Project Builds

Gradle supports multi-project builds for managing large applications with multiple modules.

### Example Structure

```
rootProject/
├── settings.gradle
├── build.gradle
├── app/
│   └── build.gradle
└── lib/
    └── build.gradle
```

### Defining Modules

In `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'MyProject'
include 'app', 'lib'
```

Each sub-project can have its own `build.gradle`, with dependencies shared or isolated as needed.

---

## Summary

This tutorial covered the basics of Gradle:

1. **Setting up Gradle** and creating a new project.
2. **Understanding `build.gradle`** for dependency management and configuration.
3. **Running common Gradle commands** for building, testing, and cleaning.
4. **Using Gradle Wrapper** for consistent builds.
5. **Creating custom tasks** and managing multi-project builds.

Gradle is versatile and customizable, making it a strong choice for automating project builds and dependency management.
