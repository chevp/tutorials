# Vulkan Memory Management Tutorial

Vulkan provides developers with explicit control over memory management, allowing for efficient allocation and deallocation of GPU resources. Understanding how to manage memory in Vulkan is essential for optimizing performance in graphics applications. This tutorial will guide you through the concepts and techniques for memory management in Vulkan.

## 1. Introduction to Vulkan Memory Management

Memory management in Vulkan is explicit and requires developers to manually allocate, bind, and free memory. This level of control allows for more efficient resource utilization, but it also requires a good understanding of the underlying hardware and memory architecture.

### Key Concepts

- **Memory Types**: Different types of memory available on the GPU (e.g., device-local, host-visible).
- **Memory Allocation**: The process of reserving memory for buffers and images.
- **Memory Binding**: Associating allocated memory with resources like buffers and images.

## 2. Memory Types and Heaps

### Step 1: Querying Memory Properties

Before allocating memory, query the physical device for its memory properties. This will give you information about the available memory types and heaps.

```c
VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties memProperties;
vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties(physicalDevice, &memProperties);

// Print memory types and heaps
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < memProperties.memoryTypeCount; i++) {
    std::cout << "Memory Type " << i << ": " << memProperties.memoryTypes[i].propertyFlags << std::endl;
}
```

### Step 2: Understanding Memory Types

Each memory type has a set of properties that define how it can be used. Common flags include:

- **VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT**: Memory that is fast for the device to access but not directly accessible by the host.
- **VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT**: Memory that can be mapped to the host, allowing CPU access.
- **VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT**: Memory that is automatically coherent between host and device.

## 3. Allocating Memory

### Step 1: Creating a Buffer

When you create a buffer, you need to specify its usage and size:

```c
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = {};
bufferInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO;
bufferInfo.size = bufferSize; // Size of the buffer
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT; // Usage flags
bufferInfo.sharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE; // Sharing mode

VkBuffer buffer;
vkCreateBuffer(device, &bufferInfo, nullptr, &buffer);
```

### Step 2: Querying Memory Requirements

After creating the buffer, query its memory requirements:

```c
VkMemoryRequirements memRequirements;
vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements(device, buffer, &memRequirements);
```

### Step 3: Allocating Memory

Allocate memory based on the requirements:

```c
VkMemoryAllocateInfo allocInfo = {};
allocInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_INFO;
allocInfo.allocationSize = memRequirements.size;
allocInfo.memoryTypeIndex = findMemoryType(physicalDevice, memRequirements.memoryTypeBits, VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT);

VkDeviceMemory bufferMemory;
if (vkAllocateMemory(device, &allocInfo, nullptr, &bufferMemory) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to allocate buffer memory!");
}
```

### Step 4: Binding Memory to the Buffer

After allocating memory, bind it to the buffer:

```c
vkBindBufferMemory(device, buffer, bufferMemory, 0);
```

---

## 4. Mapping and Unmapping Memory

### Step 1: Mapping Memory

If the memory is host-visible, you can map it to the CPU's address space for access:

```c
void* data;
vkMapMemory(device, bufferMemory, 0, bufferSize, 0, &data);
memcpy(data, vertices.data(), (size_t)bufferSize); // Copy data
vkUnmapMemory(device, bufferMemory);
```

### Step 2: Unmapping Memory

After you are done with the memory, unmap it:

```c
vkUnmapMemory(device, bufferMemory);
```

---

## 5. Cleaning Up

When you are done with the buffer and its associated memory, ensure to clean them up:

### Step 1: Free Memory

To free the allocated memory, use:

```c
vkFreeMemory(device, bufferMemory, nullptr);
```

### Step 2: Destroy the Buffer

Finally, destroy the buffer:

```c
vkDestroyBuffer(device, buffer, nullptr);
```

## 6. Conclusion

Vulkan's explicit memory management allows developers to optimize resource utilization and performance. This tutorial covered the basics of querying memory properties, allocating memory for buffers, and mapping and unmapping memory.
