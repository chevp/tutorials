# Design Patterns Tutorial

## Introduction
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help developers create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. This tutorial covers key design patterns categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

---

## 1. Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on the process of object creation.

### 1.1 Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

### 1.2 Factory Method Pattern
Provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

---

## 2. Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition and relationships.

### 2.1 Adapter Pattern
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.

### 2.2 Decorator Pattern
Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.

---

## 3. Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects.

### 3.1 Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.

### 3.2 Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

## Conclusion
This tutorial introduced essential design patterns that help in writing better software. Mastering these patterns will improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
