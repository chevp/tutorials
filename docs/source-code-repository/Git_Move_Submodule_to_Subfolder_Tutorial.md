# Tutorial: Moving a Git Submodule to a Subfolder

In this tutorial, you will learn how to move an existing Git submodule to a different subfolder within your parent repository. This process involves updating the submodule's path in the configuration and moving the physical directory.

---

## Steps to Move an Existing Submodule to a Subfolder

### 1. Navigate to Your Parent Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your parent Git repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/parent/repo
```

### 2. Remove the Submodule Reference

Use the `git submodule deinit` command to remove the submodule reference temporarily. Replace `submodule_name` with the current path of your submodule:

```bash
git submodule deinit submodule_name
```

### 3. Remove the Submodule Entry

Next, remove the submodule entry from the `.gitmodules` file. Open the `.gitmodules` file in a text editor and delete the section that corresponds to the submodule.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to remove the submodule's entry from the index (this does not delete the actual submodule directory yet):

```bash
git rm --cached submodule_name
```

### 4. Move the Submodule Directory

Now, move the submodule directory to the new location (the subfolder). You can do this using the command line:

```bash
mv submodule_name subfolder/
```

Replace `submodule_name` with the actual name of your submodule and `subfolder/` with the desired subfolder path.

### 5. Update the Submodule Path

Open the `.gitmodules` file again and update the path for the submodule to reflect its new location. For example:

```ini
[submodule "subfolder/submodule_name"]
    path = subfolder/submodule_name
    url = https://github.com/chevp/tutorials.git
```

### 6. Re-add the Submodule

After updating the path in the `.gitmodules` file, re-add the submodule with the new path:

```bash
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/chevp/tutorials.git subfolder/submodule_name
```

Note: The `-b main` flag is optional and is used if you want to track a specific branch.

### 7. Update the Submodule

Initialize and update the submodule again:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 8. Commit the Changes

Finally, stage the changes and commit them:

```bash
git add .gitmodules subfolder/submodule_name
git commit -m "Moved submodule to subfolder"
```

## Summary

By following these steps, you will have successfully moved an existing Git submodule to a specified subfolder within your parent repository. Remember to verify that the submodule is functioning as expected after moving it, especially if other developers or automated systems depend on its configuration.
