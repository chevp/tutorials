# C# gRPC Integration Tutorial

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers. This tutorial covers the basics of setting up a gRPC server and client in C# using .NET.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET SDK**: Ensure the .NET SDK (version 5 or higher) is installed on your system.
    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

2. **Protobuf Compiler (optional)**: To define and work with Protocol Buffers (.proto files), install `protoc`. (Note: Visual Studio and `dotnet` handle .proto compilation automatically).

---

## 1. Setting Up a New gRPC Project

### Step 1: Create a gRPC Server Project

Run the following command to create a new gRPC server project:

```bash
dotnet new grpc -o GrpcServer
cd GrpcServer
```

The `dotnet new grpc` command creates a new project with the necessary gRPC dependencies and a default `GreeterService`.

### Step 2: Review the `protos` Folder

The template includes a `protos` folder with a file named `greet.proto`, which defines a `Greeter` service.

### Example `greet.proto` File

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

option csharp_namespace = "GrpcServer";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

This defines a `Greeter` service with a `SayHello` RPC method that takes a `HelloRequest` and returns a `HelloReply`.

---

## 2. Implementing the gRPC Server

### Step 1: Implement the Service

Open `Services/GreeterService.cs` and implement the `SayHello` method:

```csharp
using Grpc.Core;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply
        {
            Message = $"Hello, {request.Name}"
        });
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Run the Server

Run the server to test it:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This starts the gRPC server on `localhost:5001` by default.

---

## 3. Setting Up the gRPC Client

### Step 1: Create a New Console App for the Client

In a new directory, create a console app to act as the gRPC client:

```bash
dotnet new console -o GrpcClient
cd GrpcClient
```

### Step 2: Add Required gRPC and Protobuf Packages

Add `Grpc.Net.Client` and `Google.Protobuf` packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Grpc.Net.Client
dotnet add package Google.Protobuf
dotnet add package Grpc.Tools
```

### Step 3: Add the `.proto` File

Copy the `greet.proto` file from the server’s `protos` folder into the client project, and update the `.csproj` file to include it:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="protos\greet.proto" GrpcServices="Client" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Step 4: Implement the Client

Open `Program.cs` and add the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Grpc.Net.Client;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
        var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);

        var reply = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" });
        Console.WriteLine("Greeting: " + reply.Message);
    }
}
```

This client connects to the gRPC server, sends a `HelloRequest`, and prints the server's response.

### Step 5: Run the Client

Run the client from the `GrpcClient` directory:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You should see the server’s response: `"Greeting: Hello, World"`.

## Summary

This tutorial covered the basics of integrating gRPC with C# and .NET, including:

1. Creating and running a gRPC server with .NET.
2. Defining services and messages in a `.proto` file.
3. Setting up a gRPC client to communicate with the server.

gRPC provides a powerful, efficient way to handle communication between services. Explore other gRPC methods and configurations to enhance your setup.
