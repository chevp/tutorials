# JBoss Tutorial

JBoss, now known as WildFly, is a powerful open-source Java application server that implements the full Java EE (Jakarta EE) stack. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of setting up and using JBoss.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with JBoss, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK** (11 or later): Download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Maven**: Install Maven from [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Verify Installation

To check your installations, run the following commands:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

---

## 2. Downloading JBoss (WildFly)

You can download the latest version of JBoss (WildFly) from the official website:

- [WildFly Downloads](https://wildfly.org/downloads/)

### Extracting JBoss

Once downloaded, extract the archive to your preferred location:

```bash
unzip wildfly-<version>.zip
cd wildfly-<version>
```

---

## 3. Starting JBoss

You can start JBoss in standalone mode with the following command:

```bash
./bin/standalone.sh  # For Linux/Mac
.in\standalone.bat  # For Windows
```

### Accessing the Management Console

Once JBoss is running, you can access the management console at:

```
http://localhost:9990
```

Log in with the credentials you set up during installation.

## 4. Deploying a Simple Application

### Step 1: Create a Simple Web Application

You can create a simple Java EE web application. Create a directory named `hello-world` and create the following files:

**`HelloServlet.java`**

```java
package com.example;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/plain");
        response.getWriter().write("Hello, JBoss!");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a `web.xml` File

Create a file named `web.xml` in the `WEB-INF` directory:

```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" version="3.1">
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>HelloServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.HelloServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>HelloServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/hello</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```

### Step 3: Packaging the Application

Package your application into a WAR file. Navigate to the project root and create the WAR file structure:

```bash
mkdir -p hello-world/WEB-INF/classes
cp HelloServlet.java hello-world/WEB-INF/classes
cp web.xml hello-world/WEB-INF
```

You can create the WAR file using Maven or manually:

```bash
cd hello-world
jar cvf hello-world.war *
```

### Step 4: Deploying the Application

Copy the generated WAR file to the JBoss deployments directory:

```bash
cp hello-world.war $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/
```

### Step 5: Accessing the Application

Once deployed, you can access the application at:

```
http://localhost:8080/hello-world/hello
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, JBoss!
```

## 5. Managing JBoss

### Stopping JBoss

To stop JBoss, simply hit `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running, or you can stop it using the management console.

### Configuring Data Sources

You can configure data sources by editing the `standalone.xml` file located in the `standalone/configuration` directory.
