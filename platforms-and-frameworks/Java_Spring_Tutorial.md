# Java Spring Framework Tutorial

The Spring Framework is a powerful framework for building Java applications, providing comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It offers features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and a vast ecosystem for building web applications, microservices, and more.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with Spring, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK** (8 or later): Download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Maven**: Install Maven from [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Verify Installation

To check your installations, run the following commands:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

---

## 2. Creating a New Spring Project

You can create a new Spring project using Spring Initializr, a web-based tool for generating Spring projects.

### Using Spring Initializr

1. Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
2. Select your preferred project metadata:
   - Project: Maven Project
   - Language: Java
   - Spring Boot: (latest stable version)
3. Add dependencies such as **Spring Web** and **Spring Data JPA**.
4. Click **Generate**, which will download a ZIP file containing your project.

### Using Maven Command

Alternatively, you can create a new Spring Boot project using Maven with the following command:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=spring-boot-demo -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
cd spring-boot-demo
```

---

## 3. Project Structure

After creating the project, the structure will look like this:

```
spring-boot-demo
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java
│   │   │   └── com
│   │   │       └── example
│   │   │           └── springbootdemo
│   │   │               └── SpringBootDemoApplication.java
│   │   └── resources
│   │       └── application.properties
└── pom.xml
```

---

## 4. Creating a REST Controller

### Create a REST Controller Class

Create a new Java class named `HelloController.java` in the `src/main/java/com/example/springbootdemo` directory:

```java
package com.example.springbootdemo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **@RestController**: Indicates that this class will handle web requests.
- **@GetMapping**: Maps HTTP GET requests to the `sayHello` method.

---

## 5. Running Your Application

You can run your Spring Boot application using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Accessing the Endpoint

Once the application is running, open your web browser or a tool like `curl` to access the endpoint:

```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, Spring Boot!
```

---

## 6. Adding Dependencies

You can easily add dependencies to your Spring project by modifying the `pom.xml` file. For example, to add Spring Data JPA:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Refresh Dependencies

After modifying `pom.xml`, refresh your Maven project. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, this can typically be done through the IDE interface.

---

## 7. Connecting to a Database

To connect your Spring application to a database, you can use properties in the `application.properties` file.

### Example Configuration

For a PostgreSQL database, add the following to `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Make sure to include the PostgreSQL dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

---

## 8. Building the Application

To build a production-ready package of your application, run:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

This will create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

---

## 9. Deploying to Production

You can run the generated JAR file in production by executing the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/spring-boot-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Make sure your production environment has the necessary configurations and dependencies.

## 10. Conclusion

Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, especially web applications and microservices. This tutorial covered the basics of setting up a Spring project, creating a RESTful service, and connecting to a database.
