# Creating Node.js Module Libraries

Node.js allows developers to create reusable libraries and publish them as modules. These modules can be shared on npm, allowing other developers to integrate them into their projects easily. This tutorial guides you through creating, packaging, and publishing a Node.js library module.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
2. **npm Account** (optional): To publish your library to the npm registry, create an account at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).

---

## 1. Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your library:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-node-library
   cd my-node-library
   ```

2. Initialize the project with npm:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

This creates a `package.json` file to manage the projectâ€™s metadata and dependencies.

---

## 2. Writing the Library Code

In the root of your project, create an `index.js` file. This file acts as the entry point for your library.

### Example: A Simple Math Library

Add the following code to `index.js` to create a library that provides basic math functions:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

module.exports = {
    add,
    subtract
};
```

---

## 3. Configuring `package.json`

Open `package.json` and add an entry point under the `"main"` property:

```json
"main": "index.js",
```

You can also add metadata like `"description"`, `"keywords"`, `"author"`, and `"license"` to make the module more descriptive.

---

## 4. Adding a README

Create a `README.md` file to provide documentation for your library:

```markdown
# My Node Library

A simple Node.js library for basic math functions.

## Installation

```bash
npm install my-node-library
```

## Usage

```javascript
const myNodeLibrary = require('my-node-library');

console.log(myNodeLibrary.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(myNodeLibrary.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```
```

This README will be displayed on your npm package page after publishing.

---

## 5. Testing the Module Locally

To test the module locally, create a new file `test.js` in the project directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const myNodeLibrary = require('./index');

console.log(myNodeLibrary.add(5, 3)); // Expected output: 8
console.log(myNodeLibrary.subtract(5, 3)); // Expected output: 2
```

Run the test with:

```bash
node test.js
```

---

## 6. Publishing the Module to npm (Optional)

If you want to publish your library to npm:

### Step 1: Log In to npm

```bash
npm login
```

Follow the prompts to log in with your npm credentials.

### Step 2: Update the `name` in `package.json`

Ensure the `"name"` field in `package.json` is unique and follows the format `my-node-library`.

### Step 3: Publish the Library

Publish your library with:

```bash
npm publish
```

Your module will now be available on npm, and others can install it using `npm install my-node-library`.

---

## 7. Updating the Module

When you make changes and want to publish a new version:

1. Update the version number in `package.json` according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
2. Run `npm publish` to upload the new version.

---

## Summary

This tutorial covered the basics of creating and publishing a Node.js module:

1. Setting up a new project and writing the library code.
2. Configuring `package.json` and adding documentation.
3. Testing the module locally.
4. Publishing the module to npm (optional).

Creating libraries as Node.js modules allows you to build reusable components and share them with the developer community.
