# Microservices Tutorial

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service in a microservices architecture is self-contained, focuses on a specific business capability, and communicates with other services over a network.

---

## 1. What are Microservices?

Microservices break down applications into loosely coupled, independently deployable services. This modular approach allows for faster development, scaling, and resilience.

### Key Characteristics

- **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on one business capability.
- **Independently Deployable**: Each service can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently.
- **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service has its own database, promoting autonomy.
- **Technology Agnostic**: Microservices can be built with different languages or frameworks.

---

## 2. Benefits of Microservices

- **Scalability**: Scale only the services that need it, optimizing resource usage.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service does not necessarily impact others.
- **Flexibility**: Use different technologies for each service based on requirements.
- **Faster Deployment**: Smaller codebases and isolated services lead to quicker deployments.

## 3. Challenges of Microservices

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple services is more complex than a monolithic application.
- **Communication Overhead**: Services must communicate over a network, which adds latency.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistency across distributed databases can be challenging.
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Requires specialized tools for observability and tracing.

## 4. Microservices Architecture Components

### API Gateway

An **API Gateway** acts as an entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.

### Service Registry

A **Service Registry** keeps track of the locations of all services and allows dynamic discovery of services by other services.

### Load Balancer

A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming requests across instances of a service.

### Messaging Queue

A **Message Queue** or **Event Bus** enables asynchronous communication between services.

## 5. Designing a Microservices Architecture

### Step 1: Define Services by Business Capability

Identify the core business domains and design services around them. For example:

- **User Service**: Manages user data and authentication.
- **Order Service**: Handles order processing and status.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory levels.

### Step 2: Database per Service

Each service should manage its own database to ensure loose coupling. For example:

- **User Service**: MongoDB
- **Order Service**: PostgreSQL
- **Inventory Service**: MySQL

### Step 3: Communication Between Services

- **Synchronous Communication**: Use HTTP/REST or gRPC for real-time requests.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Use messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for non-blocking operations.

## 6. Implementing Microservices with Spring Boot

### Setting Up a Basic Service

1. **Create a Spring Boot Project**:

    Use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new Spring Boot project with dependencies for **Web**, **JPA**, and **MySQL**.

2. **Define the Service Class**:

    ```java
    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/api/users")
    public class UserController {
    
        @GetMapping("/{id}")
        public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
            return ResponseEntity.ok(new User(id, "John Doe"));
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Database Configuration**:

    Set up database configuration in `application.properties`.

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/users
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=password
    ```

### Running Multiple Services

Set up additional services (e.g., Order Service, Inventory Service) following the same steps.

## 7. API Gateway and Service Discovery

Use **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing requests, and **Eureka** as a Service Registry.

### Eureka Server Configuration

1. **Add Eureka Dependency**:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Enable Eureka Server**:

    ```java
    @EnableEurekaServer
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class EurekaServerApplication {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
        }
    }
    ```

### API Gateway Configuration

1. **Add Spring Cloud Gateway Dependency**:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Set Up Routes in application.yml**:

    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: user-service
              uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
              predicates:
                - Path=/api/users/**
    ```

## 8. Monitoring and Observability

Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and **Zipkin** for distributed tracing.

- **Prometheus**: Collects and queries metrics from services.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes data collected by Prometheus.
- **Zipkin**: Traces and shows timing of requests across services.

This tutorial covered the basics of microservices:

1. **Defining Microservices** and understanding their components.
2. **Designing a Microservices Architecture** around business capabilities.
3. **Implementing Microservices** using Spring Boot.
4. **Setting up Service Discovery and API Gateway** for routing and load balancing.

Microservices provide a powerful way to build scalable and maintainable applications, enabling rapid deployment and scaling of individual services.
