## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK** (11 or later): Download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **SonarQube**: Download the latest version from the [SonarQube Downloads page](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/).
- **Maven** (if using Java): Install Maven from [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Verify Installation

To check if Java is installed correctly, run:

```bash
java -version
```

## 2. Setting Up SonarQube

### Step 1: Download and Extract SonarQube

1. Download SonarQube from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a preferred location:

   ```bash
   unzip sonarqube-<version>.zip
   cd sonarqube-<version>
   ```

### Step 2: Starting SonarQube

1. Navigate to the `bin` directory:

   ```bash
   cd bin/<your-os>  # e.g., cd bin/linux-x86-64 or cd bin/windows-x86-64
   ```

2. Start SonarQube:

   - For Linux/Mac:

   ```bash
   ./sonar.sh start
   ```

   - For Windows:

   ```bash
   StartSonar.bat
   ```

### Step 3: Accessing SonarQube

Once SonarQube is running, you can access the dashboard at:

```
http://localhost:9000
```

The default credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

**Change the default password after the first login.**

## 3. Analyzing Your Project

### Step 1: Configure Your Project

You can analyze a project using Maven, Gradle, or any other build tool. Hereâ€™s how to do it with Maven:

1. Navigate to your project directory and add the SonarQube plugin to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <sonar.projectKey>your_project_key</sonar.projectKey>
    <sonar.host.url>http://localhost:9000</sonar.host.url>
    <sonar.login>admin</sonar.login> <!-- Replace with your username -->
    <sonar.password>admin</sonar.password> <!-- Replace with your password -->
</properties>
```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis

Run the following command in your project directory to perform the analysis:

```bash
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar
```

### Step 3: Viewing Results

After the analysis is complete, you can view the results in the SonarQube dashboard by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:9000/projects
```

## 4. Configuring Quality Gates

Quality Gates are a set of conditions a project must meet before it can be considered acceptable.

### Step 1: Accessing Quality Gates

In the SonarQube dashboard, go to the **Quality Gates** section in the menu. Here you can define the criteria for your project's quality gates.

### Step 2: Creating a Quality Gate

1. Click on **Create**.
2. Define the conditions (e.g., code coverage, code smells).
3. Assign the quality gate to your project.

## 5. Conclusion

SonarQube is a powerful tool for monitoring code quality and security vulnerabilities in your projects. This tutorial provided an introduction to setting up SonarQube and analyzing a project.
