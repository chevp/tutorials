# Git Branches Tutorial

Git branching is an essential feature that enables developers to work on separate features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. This tutorial covers Git branches, including creating, switching, merging, and deleting branches in a Git project.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system.
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

2. **Basic Knowledge of Git**: Familiarity with basic Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` is helpful.

---

## 1. Understanding Branches

In Git, branches represent different lines of development. The main branch is usually called `main` (or `master` in older projects). Creating a new branch allows you to make changes independently of the main branch.

---

## 2. Creating a New Branch

To create a new branch in Git, use the `git branch` command:

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

### Example

```bash
git branch feature-branch
```

This command creates a branch named `feature-branch` based on the current state of your code.

---

## 3. Switching to a Branch

To switch to a branch, use the `git checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in one command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Example

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

This command creates a `new-feature` branch and checks it out.

---

## 4. Viewing Branches

To view all branches in your repository, use:

```bash
git branch
```

The active branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

---

## 5. Merging Branches

Once you've completed work on a branch, you may want to merge it into the main branch.

### Step 1: Switch to the Main Branch

First, switch to the main branch (or any other branch you want to merge into):

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Merge the Feature Branch

Use the `git merge` command to merge your feature branch into the main branch:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Example

```bash
git merge new-feature
```

This command merges the changes from `new-feature` into the `main` branch.

---

## 6. Resolving Merge Conflicts

If Git detects conflicting changes between branches, a merge conflict occurs. To resolve merge conflicts:

1. Open the files with conflicts in a text editor.
2. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>`) to see the changes.
3. Edit the file to keep the desired changes.
4. Add the resolved files to staging:

    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    ```

5. Commit the merge:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
    ```

---

## 7. Deleting a Branch

Once a branch is merged, you can delete it to keep your repository clean.

### Delete a Local Branch

To delete a branch locally, use:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Use the `-D` option to force delete a branch if it has unmerged changes:

```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

### Delete a Remote Branch

To delete a branch from the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

## 8. Summary of Branch Commands

| Command                                    | Description                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `git branch <branch-name>`                 | Create a new branch                               |
| `git checkout <branch-name>`               | Switch to a branch                                |
| `git checkout -b <branch-name>`            | Create and switch to a new branch                 |
| `git branch`                               | List all branches                                 |
| `git merge <branch-name>`                  | Merge a branch into the current branch            |
| `git branch -d <branch-name>`              | Delete a local branch                             |
| `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`   | Delete a remote branch                            |

## Summary

This tutorial introduced the basics of Git branches, including:

1. Creating, switching, and viewing branches.
2. Merging branches and resolving conflicts.
3. Deleting branches locally and remotely.

Using branches in Git allows for isolated development, making collaboration and code management more effective.
