# Java Tutorial

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is platform-independent, meaning Java code can run on any device or operating system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Setting Up Java

To get started with Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a code editor.

### Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website: [JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Verify Installation
After installation, verify that Java is installed by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
```bash
java -version
```

### Install an IDE
You can use any text editor, but an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will make writing Java programs much easier.

## Basic Java Syntax

### Hello World Program
The simplest Java program is the "Hello World" program. It looks like this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation:
- `public class HelloWorld`: Defines a public class named `HelloWorld`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: The `main` method, which is the entry point for any Java application.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: Prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Working with Classes and Objects

### Defining a Class
In Java, everything is based on objects and classes. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Here's an example of a simple class:

```java
public class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
    
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting.");
    }
}
```

### Creating an Object
Once you have a class, you can create objects based on that class.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Create a Car object
        myCar.make = "Toyota";  // Set the car's make
        myCar.model = "Corolla"; // Set the car's model
        myCar.start(); // Call the start method
    }
}
```

## Control Flow in Java

Java provides several control flow statements to make decisions and repeat code.

### If-Else Statement
```java
int number = 10;
if (number > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is greater than 5.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is less than or equal to 5.");
}
```

### For Loop
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("i is: " + i);
}
```

### While Loop
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("i is: " + i);
    i++;
}
```

## Java Methods

In Java, methods are used to perform actions. Methods can take parameters and return values.

### Defining a Method
```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Calling a Method
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.add(5, 3); // Call the add method
        System.out.println("The result is: " + result);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of Java, including setting up your environment, writing basic syntax, working with classes and objects, using control flow statements, and defining methods. Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in software development, from web applications to mobile and desktop software.
