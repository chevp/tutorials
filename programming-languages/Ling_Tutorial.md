# Ling Programming Language Tutorial

Ling is a lightweight, open-source programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of using Ling, including installation, syntax, and creating a simple program.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with Ling, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Ling Compiler**: Download and install the Ling compiler from the [Ling GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ling-lang/ling).

### Verify Installation

To check if Ling is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
ling --version
```

---

## 2. Setting Up Your Ling Environment

### Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

Create a new directory for your Ling project:

```bash
mkdir my-ling-project
cd my-ling-project
```

### Step 2: Create a Ling File

Create a new file with the `.ling` extension. For example, create a file named `hello.ling`:

```bash
touch hello.ling
```

---

## 3. Writing Your First Program

Open `hello.ling` in your favorite text editor and write the following code:

```ling
println("Hello, Ling!")
```

### Explanation

- **println**: A built-in function to print text to the console.

---

## 4. Running Your Program

To run your Ling program, use the following command:

```bash
ling hello.ling
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, Ling!
```

---

## 5. Basic Syntax

### Variables

You can declare variables using the `let` keyword:

```ling
let name = "Alice"
println(name)
```

### Control Structures

Ling supports standard control structures like `if`, `for`, and `while`.

#### If Statement

```ling
if (name == "Alice") {
    println("Hello, Alice!")
} else {
    println("Hello, stranger!")
}
```

#### For Loop

```ling
for i in range(5) {
    println(i)
}
```

### Functions

You can define functions using the `func` keyword:

```ling
func greet(name) {
    println("Hello, " + name + "!")
}

greet("Bob")
```

---

## 6. Working with Collections

Ling supports arrays and maps for handling collections of data.

### Arrays

```ling
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
println(fruits[0])  // Outputs: apple
```

### Maps

```ling
let ages = {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
println(ages["Alice"])  // Outputs: 30
```

## 7. Conclusion

Ling is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language that can be used for a variety of applications. This tutorial covered the basics of setting up your Ling environment, writing your first program, and understanding basic syntax.
