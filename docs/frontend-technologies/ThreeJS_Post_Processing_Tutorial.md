# Three.js Post-Processing Effects Tutorial

Post-processing effects enhance the visual quality of a rendered scene by applying effects after the main rendering process. This tutorial will guide you through setting up various post-processing effects using Three.js.

## 1. Introduction to Post-Processing

Post-processing in Three.js involves the use of shaders and effects that are applied to the final rendered image. Common effects include bloom, depth of field, motion blur, and film grain. These effects can significantly improve the visual appeal of your 3D scenes.

### Key Concepts

- **Effect Composer**: A utility that manages the rendering of multiple passes and applies post-processing effects.
- **Render Pass**: A single rendering operation that can include a scene and a camera.

## 2. Setting Up the Scene

Before implementing post-processing effects, you need to set up a basic Three.js scene.

### Step 1: Create a Basic Scene

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
```

## 3. Adding Post-Processing with Effect Composer

### Step 1: Include the Effect Composer

You need to include the `EffectComposer`, `RenderPass`, and any desired effect passes from the Three.js examples.

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js"></script>
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/RenderPass.js"></script>
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Setting Up Effect Composer

Set up the Effect Composer in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const composer = new THREE.EffectComposer(renderer);

// Render Pass
const renderPass = new THREE.RenderPass(scene, camera);
composer.addPass(renderPass);

// Create and configure a bloom pass
const bloomPass = new THREE.UnrealBloomPass(new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight), 1.5, 0.4, 0.85);
composer.addPass(bloomPass);
```

### Step 3: Rendering with Composer

In the animation loop, render using the composer instead of the renderer directly:

```javascript
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);

    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

    composer.render(); // Render the scene using the composer
}

animate(); // Start the animation loop
```

## 4. Adding Additional Post-Processing Effects

You can enhance your scene with additional effects by adding more passes to the Effect Composer.

### Step 1: Adding Depth of Field Effect

To add a depth of field effect, you can use the `BokehPass` (assuming it's included):

```html
<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/BokehPass.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Configure Bokeh Pass

Add and configure the Bokeh pass:

```javascript
const bokehPass = new THREE.BokehPass(scene, camera, {
    focus: 1.0,
    aperture: 0.025,
    maxDepth: 10.0,
    minDepth: 0.0,
});

composer.addPass(bokehPass);
```

### Step 3: Rendering with Multiple Effects

Ensure to render using the composer in your animation loop:

```javascript
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);

    // Update any scene objects here
    composer.render(); // Render with all added passes
}

animate(); // Start the animation loop
```
