# CSS Tutorial

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the style of HTML documents. CSS controls the look and feel of a website, allowing you to change colors, layout, fonts, and more. This tutorial covers the basics of using CSS to style HTML.

---

## 1. CSS Syntax

CSS styles are written as rules. Each rule has a selector, followed by a declaration block enclosed in curly braces (`{}`). Declarations are written as `property: value;` pairs.

### Example

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

In this example, the `h1` selector applies styles to all `<h1>` elements, setting their color to blue and font size to 24 pixels.

## 2. Adding CSS to HTML

CSS can be added in three main ways:

### Inline CSS

Add CSS directly to an HTML elementâ€™s `style` attribute.

```html
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello, World!</h1>
```

### Internal CSS

Use the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML file.

```html
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

### External CSS

Link an external CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

## 3. Selectors

### Type Selector

Selects all elements of a given type.

```css
p {
    color: green;
}
```

### Class Selector

Selects elements with a specific class. Classes are prefixed with a dot (`.`).

```css
.header {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

### ID Selector

Selects elements with a specific ID. IDs are prefixed with a hash (`#`).

```css
#main-title {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Attribute Selector

Selects elements with a specific attribute.

```css
input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

## 4. Common Properties

### Colors

- **Text Color**: `color`
- **Background Color**: `background-color`

```css
p {
    color: red;
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

### Fonts

- **Font Size**: `font-size`
- **Font Family**: `font-family`
- **Font Weight**: `font-weight`

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Borders and Padding

- **Border**: `border`
- **Padding**: `padding`
- **Margin**: `margin`

```css
.box {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 20px;
}
```

## 5. Layout with Flexbox

Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layouts.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Flexbox Properties

- **justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis.
- **align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis.

---

## 6. Responsive Design

CSS media queries allow you to apply styles based on the device's characteristics.

### Example

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}
```

This applies a font size of 14px when the viewport width is 600px or smaller.
