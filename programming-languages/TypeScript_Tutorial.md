# TypeScript Tutorial

TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers optional static typing, interfaces, and other features to improve the developer experience and make large-scale applications more manageable.

## Installing TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it globally using npm.

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
If you donâ€™t have Node.js and npm installed, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install them.

### Step 2: Install TypeScript
Run the following command to install TypeScript globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Setting Up a TypeScript Project

### Step 1: Initialize the Project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:

```bash
mkdir my-typescript-project
cd my-typescript-project
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Create a `tsconfig.json` File
You can generate a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
tsc --init
```

This will generate a `tsconfig.json` file where you can adjust compiler options.

## TypeScript Types

TypeScript supports many types including:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `array`
- `object`
- `any`

### Example: Using Types

```typescript
let name: string = "Alice";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

### Array Types

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
let numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
```

### `any` Type

```typescript
let value: any = "Hello";
value = 10;  // This is allowed with the `any` type
```

---

## TypeScript Functions

In TypeScript, you can define functions with type annotations for both parameters and the return value.

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

### Function with Optional Parameter

```typescript
function greet(name: string, age?: number): string {
  return age ? `Hello, ${name}, Age: ${age}` : `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

---

## Working with Classes

TypeScript adds features like access modifiers and type annotations to JavaScript classes.

### Example: Defining a Class

```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): string {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

let person = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(person.greet());
```

---

## Modules and Namespaces

TypeScript allows you to use modules and namespaces to organize your code.

### Importing and Exporting Modules

```typescript
// greet.ts
export function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

// app.ts
import { greet } from './greet';
console.log(greet("Alice"));
```

---

## Compiling TypeScript

To compile TypeScript files to JavaScript, use the `tsc` command:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

This will generate an `app.js` file.

To compile all TypeScript files in your project, run:

```bash
tsc
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful language that helps catch errors early through static typing. It enhances JavaScript with object-oriented features and helps manage large-scale applications. With the installation and basic concepts covered in this tutorial, you can now start building TypeScript applications.
