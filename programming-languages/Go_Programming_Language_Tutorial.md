# Go Programming Language Tutorial

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. It is statically typed and compiled, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with Go, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Go**: Download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Verify Installation

To check if Go is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
go version
```

## 2. Setting Up Your Go Workspace

Go uses a workspace structure to manage source code. Follow these steps to set up your workspace:

1. **Create a Workspace Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/go-workspace
   cd ~/go-workspace
   ```

2. **Set the GOPATH Environment Variable**:
   Add the following to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file:

   ```bash
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go-workspace
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   ```

3. **Source the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.bash_profile / source ~/.zshrc
   ```

---

## 3. Creating Your First Go Program

### Create a Go File

1. **Create a Directory for Your Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/go-workspace/src/hello
   cd ~/go-workspace/src/hello
   ```

2. **Create a File Named `main.go`**:
   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
   }
   ```

### Running Your Program

To run your Go program, use the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, Go!
```

## 4. Understanding Go Syntax

### Variables and Types

Go supports various data types, including integers, floats, booleans, and strings.

```go
var name string = "Alice"
var age int = 30
var height float64 = 5.5
isStudent := true  // short variable declaration
```

### Control Structures

Go uses control structures like `if`, `for`, and `switch`:

#### If Statement

```go
if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Minor")
}
```

#### For Loop

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

#### Switch Statement

```go
switch day := "Monday"; day {
case "Monday":
    fmt.Println("Start of the week")
case "Friday":
    fmt.Println("End of the week")
default:
    fmt.Println("Midweek")
}
```

## 5. Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in Go.

### Defining a Function

```go
func greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello, " + name
}
```

### Calling a Function

```go
message := greet("Alice")
fmt.Println(message)
```

---

## 6. Structs and Interfaces

Go supports user-defined types such as structs and interfaces.

### Defining a Struct

```go
type Person struct {
    Name   string
    Age    int
}
```

### Using a Struct

```go
p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
fmt.Println(p.Name)
```

### Defining an Interface

```go
type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}
```

### Implementing an Interface

```go
type Dog struct{}
func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof!"
}
```

---

## 7. Go Modules

Go modules manage dependencies in Go projects.

### Initializing a Module

Run the following command to create a new module:

```bash
go mod init example.com/myproject
```

### Adding Dependencies

You can add dependencies using:

```bash
go get <package-name>
```

---

## 8. Building Your Application

To build your Go application into a binary, use the following command:

```bash
go build
```

This will create an executable file in the current directory.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Go is a powerful and efficient programming language that is well-suited for building scalable applications. This tutorial covered the basics of setting up a Go environment, writing your first program, and understanding Go's syntax and features.
